= THE Dictionary
:author: nirokay

== About

**THE Dictionary** is a basic and crappy clone of online, user-run dictionaries
like https://www.urbandictionary.com/[Urban Dictionary].

== Capabilities

=== New definitions

Well, kinda necessary for a user-run dictionary... you can add your new
definitions at `/submit/`.

==== Submission without website UI

It is possible to submit new definitions through just the URL.
Submission URLs follow this convention: `/submit/{base64 encoded json}`.

**Example payload:**

[source,json]
----
{
    "word": "example",
    "definition": "a lot of text, bla bla bla",
    "author": "me"
}
----

Using a base64 encoder will yield us the following string:
[source,base64]
----
eyJ3b3JkIjoiZXhhbXBsZSIsImRlZmluaXRpb24iOiJhIGxvdCBvZiB0ZXh0LCBibGEgYmxhIGJsYSIsImF1dGhvciI6Im1lIn0=
----

We can use this to send a POST request:
[source,bash]
----
curl "localhost:80/submit/eyJ3b3JkIjoiZXhhbXBsZSIsImRlZmluaXRpb24iOiJhIGxvdCBvZiB0ZXh0LCBibGEgYmxhIGJsYSIsImF1dGhvciI6Im1lIn0="
----

=== Querying definitions

All definition queries are available under `/definitions/`, while a single
definition is available under `/definition/{id}` (for example:
`definition/24`).

You can also search for definitions of a specific word with
`/definitions/{word}` (for example: `/definition/word`).

SQLite query parameters are also available at your disposal:
* `/definitions/a%` queries all entries staring with `a`
* `/definitions/%the%` queries all entries that have `the` in them
