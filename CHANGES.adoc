== v1.1.0

=== Visuals

Reworked CSS.

=== (Potentially) Breaking changes

Reworked the way submissions work. Prior to this they were submitted using the Url path `/submit/{payload}`.
`payload` being a base64 encoded JSON object. This did not work well with characters outside the ASCII range.

Now submissions are inside the HTTP body request and encoded using URL encoding.
