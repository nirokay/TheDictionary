= Changelog

== v1.1.1

=== Improvements

Executables are now fully standalone: JavaScript is embedded into the executable (just like the SQLite statements).

=== QoL

Added message on startup and added `ctrl+c` hook to graciously close the server.

== v1.1.0

=== Visuals

Reworked CSS.

=== (Potentially) Breaking changes

Reworked the way submissions work. Prior to this they were submitted using the Url path `/submit/{payload}`.
`payload` being a base64 encoded JSON object. This did not work well with characters outside the ASCII range.

Now submissions are inside the HTTP body request and encoded using URL encoding.

== v1.0.0
